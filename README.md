# ***Golden Coffee***

## Introduction

Welcome to "Golden Coffee Theme". This theme only have a dark version. The reason for that is: *I dont use light mode ( -_-), Â¿who use it anyway? (Im just kidding, I just find dark mode more comfy that light mode, nothing more (please dont kill me, Im just joking))* [PD: *I actually did make the Light Theme*] 


> ## Update <05/08/2021>
>
> ### Light Theme
> - I finally did it, the Light Theme. Enjoy :D
> ### Fixes
> - _Most of them are just color scheme related_
> - _Kanban_: The title had the wrong dimensions. I fixed it and customized to the color scheme.
