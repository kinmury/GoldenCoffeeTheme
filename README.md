# ***Golden Coffee***

## Introduction

Welcome to "Golden Coffee Theme". This theme only have a dark version. The reason for that is: *I dont use light mode ( -_-), Â¿who use it anyway? (Im just kidding, I just find dark mode more comfy that light mode, nothing more (please dont kill me, Im just joking))* [PD: *I actually did make the Light Theme*]
