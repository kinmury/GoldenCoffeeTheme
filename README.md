<h1 align=center>Golden Coffee</h1>

<p align=center>Welcome to Golden Coffee. As of today, 2021/11/05, I just made the Rework of the theme. The main reason behind the rework is the fact that I have gain a little more experience of CSS, and know how to make the previews thinks look better.<br><br>Be aware that the changes may be very big between the previews Golden Coffee, and the actual <i>Golden Coffe</i>. So, if you liked the preview version more than the actual, <b>fear not</b>, because the preview version is saved and you can download it from the <ins>releases</ins>.<br><br><b><i>Hope you like and enjoy the Rework :D</i></b></p>
