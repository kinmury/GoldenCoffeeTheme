# ***Golden Coffee***

## Introduction

Welcome to "Golden Coffee Theme". This theme only have a dark version. The reason for that is: *I dont use light mode ( -_-), Â¿who use it anyway? (Im just kidding, I just find dark mode more comfy that light mode, nothing more (please dont kill me, Im just joking))* [PD: *I actually did make the Light Theme*] 

## Style Settings

- **Active Line CodeMirror** - Change the background colour of the active line you are typing in CodeMirror.
   - Dark Mode
   - Light Mode
 - **Decoration**
   - Header Hover "ðŸ¢€" - When you hover over a header, a ðŸ¢€ will pop out.
   - **Vertical Lines - Lists** - Shows a vertical line on every list. _WARNING_: This could be a problem for those who use sync panes, since it will glitch a lot whenever you try to scroll near the lists. If you use sync panes, please keep it off.
     - Dark Mode
     - Light Mode
